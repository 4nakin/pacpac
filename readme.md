# PacPac

This is a pac-man clone.
There are many like it.
This one is mine.

The current code was written in less than 24 hours
to prove to my wife that I could make something like pac-man in less than a day.
(She was quite skeptical.)

Here's a fun [evolution of the game in screenshots](http://tylerneylon.com/pacpac/).

You need [love](http://love2d.org) to play.
